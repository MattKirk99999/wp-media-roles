WP-Media-Roles enables you to allow/deny access to Media based on roles.

== Description ==

WP-Media-Roles adds a list of allowed roles below the content area when editing the page for a Media item. Only the checked roles can view the Media; others will simply be redirected to the Media's page, where you can add a paywall, and/or a login.

WP-Media-Roles works well in conjunction with the Members (wordpress.org/plugins/members/) plugin to create a media-driven members-only web app.
